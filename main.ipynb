In this project, we will transform a general-purpose language model, the powerful GPT-2, into a specialized chatbot. Our goal is to leverage a dataset of 3,000 conversational pairs to teach the model a specific conversational style and knowledge base. This process, known as fine-tuning, is a cornerstone of modern NLP, allowing us to adapt massive pre-trained models for specific tasks without the prohibitive cost of training them from scratch. By the end of this notebook, you will have a functional chatbot customized with our data and a clear understanding of the end-to-end LLM fine-tuning workflow.\n","    </div>\n","\n","<div style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #81C784; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">\n","        The Core Objective\n","    </div>\n","    <div style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.7; text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n","        Our primary objective is to demonstrate the power of transfer learning in NLP.
